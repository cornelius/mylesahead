Myles Ahead is an experiment to implement a graphical client for [Project MySelf](https://github.com/cornelius/project-myself) using the [Electron Framework](http://electron.atom.io/). It resembles the functionality of the existing graphical client [Myles](https://github.com/cornelius/myles).

To run it you need to [download the Electron runtime](https://github.com/atom/electron/releases) and execute it with the Myles Ahead checkout as argument. Some more details can be found in the [Electron Quick Start](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md#run-your-app).
